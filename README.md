# Project Proposal: AI-Enhanced Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## 1. Project Title
**GuardianEye: Building a Smart Intrusion Detection System with AI**

## 2. Project Overview
This project will develop a functional IDS that monitors network traffic, detects malicious activities, and incorporates AI/ML for anomaly detection. The system will be built by a team with varying skill levels.

## 3. Objectives
- **Beginners:**
  - Learn networking fundamentals
  - Develop signature-based IDS in Python
  - Implement basic alerting systems

- **Intermediate:**
  - Integrate AI/ML models
  - Build threat dashboard
  - Optimize detection rules

## 4. Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Basic IDS 
| Task | Tools | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| Packet capture | Scapy | Traffic analysis |
| Rule detection | Regex | Threat detection |
| Alerts | smtplib | Automation |

### Phase 2: AI Integration 
| Task | Tools | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| Data collection | CIC-IDS2017 | Preprocessing |
| Model training | scikit-learn | AI security |
| Deployment | Flask | Live detection |

## 5. Deliverables
- Python IDS (GitHub)
- AI/ML model
- Dashboard
- Documentation

## 6. Requirements
- Hardware: Laptops, RPi
- Software: Python, Wireshark

## 7. Timeline
| Week | Task |
|------|------|
| 1-2 | Basic IDS |
| 3-4 | AI integration |
| 5 | Testing |


## 9. Future Work
- Honeypot
- Auto-blocking
- Threat APIs
